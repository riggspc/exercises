A collection of programming expercises and solutions I've worked on for practice. The concepts for many of these problems are from McDowell's *Cracking the Coding Interview*

The solutions for these questions are in a number of languages. Feel free to create a pull request if you'd like to solve a problem in a language of your choice, even if it's already been solved.
