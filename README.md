exercises
=========

A collection of programming exercises and solutions. Many of these will be technical interview-style questions - if you're preparing for one of those you shouldn't look at the solution file until you've at least looked at the problem. Remember, though, most companies will make you write code on a whiteboard - try to practice hand-writing your code as much as possible.
