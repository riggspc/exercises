Write a method that does the following. It takes in an unsorted array of numbers - for our purposes lets designate the lowest of these numbers 'n' and the highest 'm'. The method adds numbers (integers) to the array so as to ensure that every integer from n to m is in the array exactly once. It then returns that array in sorted order. 

Writing a sorting algorithm is not the point of this problem - you may use a built-in one.
