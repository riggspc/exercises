Write a method to do the following. It takes in an array of positive integers, representing weights of various objects, and a positive integer representing the weight capacity of a knapsack. Determine and output the maximum number of items that can be stored in the knapsack along with which items they are.

For ease of testability output your answer in a vector, with each cell representing an item and holding the weight of that item. For example:

input > [1, 2, 3], 4
output > [1, 2] or [1, 3] would both be acceptable answers

You should make a note of the time and space complexity of your approach as well as if your approach is using a certain algorithm or family of algorithms.
