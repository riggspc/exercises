You must write two methods for this problem. The first takes in a string and a key and returns a simple substitution cypher version of that string. The second takes a string and a key and decrypts that string, assuming the substitution cypher of the first method.
You can assume that both input strings will be made up of uppercase letters and the return values should as well. In other words, we should be able to round-trip.
