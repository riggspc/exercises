Write a rudimentary string compression algorithm that will compress a given string by replacing series of repeated letters
instead with a letter and then a count of how many times that letter repeats. The method will return the new string
unless the new string is longer than the given string
Ex. aaaabbbcccccccaaaaa -> a4b3c7a5
    abc -> abc (since a1b1c1 is longer than abc)
